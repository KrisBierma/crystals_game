# crystals_game


In the Crystals Collector game random values are given to four crystals. The user clicks them to discover their values and each click adds that value to the total score. A win occurs when the total score equals the random value assigned at the beginning of the game.

## Instructions

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. 

There are four crystals below. Clicking on a crystal will add a specific amount of points to your total score. 

Win the game by matching the total score to the random number. Lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. 

The value of each crystal is unknown until you click on it. 

Each time the game starts, the random number and the values of the crystals change.
